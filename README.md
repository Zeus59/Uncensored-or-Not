## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Ready or Not installed via Steam
- Minimum 50 MB free disk space

### Step 1: Navigate to Game Directory

**Option A:** Manual Navigation
```
X:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Ready Or Not\ReadyOrNot\Content\Paks\
```

**Option B:** Steam Browser
